# SnapText
Snap a photo and turn any text into copiable text for further use.
The source code is written in Python.
Build the code using any IDE.
The code require some common Python libraries (PyQt5, Pillow, io, win32clipboard, time, pyperclip) and specifically tesseract Library to perform OCR on the snapped photos.
Install the Tesseract Library separately from their GitHub page "https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract"
(using the pytesseract does not seem to work, at lease in my best effort so far).
